(a) The Network Service Provider to whom the application to connect is
submitted:
(1) at the automatic access standard under clause 5.3.4; or
NATIONAL ELECTRICITY RULES CHAPTER 5
VERSION 182 NETWORK CONNECTION ACCESS, PLANNING AND EXPANSION

the Connection Applicant of all risks and obligations in respect of the
proposed connection associated with planning and environmental laws not
contained in the Rules.
(c) The Connection Applicant must provide such other additional information in
relation to the application to connect as the Network Service Provider
reasonably requires to assess the technical performance and costs of the
required connection (including the details of any person undertaking the
construction, detailed design and/or ownership of contestable IUSA
components) or designated network asset to enable the Network Service
Provider to prepare an offer to connect.
(d) So as to maintain levels of service and quality of supply to existing
Registered Participants in accordance with the Rules, the Network Service
Provider in preparing the offer to connect must consult with AEMO and
other Registered Participants with whom it has connection agreements, if
the Network Service Provider believes in its reasonable opinion, that
compliance with the terms and conditions of those connection agreements
will be affected, in order to assess the application to connect and determine:
(1) the technical requirements for the equipment to be connected;
(2) the extent and cost of augmentations and changes to all affected
networks;
(3) any consequent change in network service charges; and
(4) any possible material effect of this new connection on the network
power transfer capability including that of other networks.
(e) The Network Service Provider preparing the offer to connect must specify in
reasonable detail any system strength connection works to be undertaken by
the Network Service Provider.
(f) [Deleted]
(g) The Network Service Provider preparing the offer to connect must include
provision for payment of the reasonable costs associated with remote
control equipment and remote monitoring equipment as required by AEMO
